- Landshare forms Corporations or LLCs in the state of Wyoming, each of which holds a single asset. Asset Tokens are sold in $50 increments, with 10% being paid in LAND and 90% being paid in BUSD. The Direct Trading feature for our Asset Tokens will allow you to buy or sell larger token amounts at a fixed rate, avoiding the price impact of the DEX. Landshare reserves the right to reject OTC requests. The Landshare Token can also be staked for rewards in the Landshare Token Staking Vault and provides access to features such as the Governance Protocol and BUSD Vault (collateral for loan).
- benefits:

    2. Real Estate NFTs
    3. Tokenized House Flipping.

## [Solidblock](https://www.solidblock.co/)
- The Blocksquare marketplace is still inactive. The only service that Blocksquare has provided until now is that it gives the property owners the ability to tokenize their real state and earn monthly profit from the BST token treasury. The minted BSPT tokens are locked for the first six months and after that the property owner can either sell the BSPT tokens in the marketplace or reverse the process of tokenization. There is no exact information available regarding the selling process of the BSPT tokens. However, Blocksquare claims that in the future they will provide a stable coin called POINT. This stable coin is supposed to act as the means of exchanging BSPT tokens. POINT is backed by the USD value of tokenized real estate assets that Oceanpoint owns. One single POINT can always be swapped for 1 USD worth of tokenized real estate held within Oceanpoint's asset pool.
